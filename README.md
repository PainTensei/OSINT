## Description
This repository contains three Python scripts developed for my graduation project for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) purposes.
OSINT refers to the process of obtaining and analyzing data from publicly available sources.
These scripts help automate repetitive tasks and process results more efficiently.

Key aspects about the scripts:

- It allows users to execute scripts on their local environment.
- The scripts are designed to be simple and easy to understand. No heavy technical knowledge needed.

## Installation

To use these scripts, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This can be installed with the command `pip install python`.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/PainTensei/OSINT`.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the scripts with `py <script_name>.py`

## Scripts

1. `original.py`: First iteration with output pasted into the console only.
2. `powerbi.py`: Script paste the output into a specific styled excel sheet that can be pasted into Power Bi for a visual dashboard.
3. `Final_script.py`: No need for Power Bi, as this script paste all data directly into a self-made dashboard hosted in your localhost.

## Usage

To use the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project folder using the command prompt or terminal.
2. Run the desired script by typing `py <script_name>.py`.
3. For the `Final_script.py` only, browse to your [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5000). The script uses port `5000`.
